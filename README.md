# Async++ Network library
This library provides a c++20 coroutine wrapper for networking and IO related functionality.
It is an addition to [async++](https://github.com/asyncpp/asyncpp) which provides general coroutine tasks and support classes.

This library is developed and tested on Ubuntu linux. There is also experimental support for MacOS.
Windows is currently unsupported.
